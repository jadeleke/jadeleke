## About
I'm a DevOps engineer with a strong background in machine learning. My research and project interests include Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) for Ghanaian languages, CNN-based computer vision, and accessible AI. I enjoy automating workflows, hardening infrastructure, and productionizing models with robust testing and monitoring.

## What I'm Working On
- CNN model for image classification in Akan Twi
- ASR for Ghanaian languages and accessibility use cases
- Scalable cloud infrastructure and CI/CD for ML services

## Learning & Interests
- Advanced cloud infrastructure: Azure, AWS, Kubernetes, CI/CD
- MLOps: training pipelines, testing, packaging, serving, monitoring
- Federated learning for privacy-preserving healthcare ML

## Ask Me About
- Cloud & DevOps: Azure, AWS, CI/CD, Kubernetes, Docker, Vagrant
- Machine Learning: NLP, CNNs, federated learning
- Data Engineering: SQL/NoSQL data pipelines and validation
