## About
I'm a DevOps and MLOps engineer with hands-on Oracle database administration experience. My research and project interests include Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) for Ghanaian languages, CNN-based computer vision, and accessible AI. I build reliable ML services and cloud-native platforms, automate workflows, and productionize models with testing, security, and observability. On the database side, I focus on performance, resilience, and automation in Oracle environments.

## What I'm Working On
- CNN model for image classification in Akan Twi
- ASR for Ghanaian languages and accessibility use cases
- Scalable cloud infrastructure and CI/CD for ML services

## Learning & Interests
- Advanced cloud infrastructure: Azure, AWS, Kubernetes, CI/CD
- MLOps: training pipelines, testing, packaging, serving, monitoring
- Federated learning for privacy-preserving healthcare ML

## Ask Me About
- Cloud & DevOps: Azure, AWS, CI/CD, Kubernetes, Docker, Vagrant
- MLOps: pipelines, model packaging/serving, monitoring, drift detection
- Oracle DBA: RMAN backup/recovery, performance tuning (AWR/ASH), Data Guard
- Data Engineering: SQL/NoSQL data pipelines and validation

## MLOps Focus
- Reproducible training: versioned data, pipelines, and rigorous evaluation
- CI/CD for ML: unit/integration tests, containerization, environment promotion
- Model serving: REST/gRPC inference on Docker/Kubernetes with autoscaling
- Observability: metrics, logs, and tracing with Grafana, Elasticsearch, Datadog
- Governance: experiment tracking, model comparison, and release discipline

## Database & DataOps Focus
- Oracle administration: backup/recovery (RMAN), HA/DR (Data Guard), patching
- Performance: SQL tuning, indexing/partitioning, AWR/ASH analysis
- Automation: PL/SQL, SQL*Plus, Bash/PowerShell, scheduled jobs
- Schema change management: repeatable migrations (Liquibase/Flyway)
- Monitoring: OEM/Cloud Control, Grafana/Prometheus, Datadog alerts
